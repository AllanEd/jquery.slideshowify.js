/**
 * Slideshowify is a jQuery plugin for generating a full-screen (well, browser dims) slideshow 
 * from images that match a selector.  Images that don't fit the window proportions exactly (generally
 * the case) are cropped and panned across the screen.
 *
 * version 0.5
 * Should appear on subchild.com, github, and jQuery plugins page at some point soon.
 * Will likely be used on Gallerama.com in some shape or form as well.
 * 
 * @TODO add more configuration options: direction, css3 prog enhancement stuff
 * @TODO consider adding support for loading images from passed array instead of from DOM
 *
 *
 * To use, just do something like this: $("img").slideshowify();
