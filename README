/**
 * Slideshowify is a jQuery plugin for generating a "Ken Burns Effect"-style slideshow from images 
 * that match a selector.  Images that don't fit the window proportions exactly (generally
 * the case) are cropped and panned across the screen. This also resembles that Mac screensaver.
 *
 * Version 0.6
 * 
 * Should appear on subchild.com, and the jQuery plugins page at some point soon.
 * Will likely be used on Gallerama.com in some shape or form as well.
 * 
 * @TODO add more configuration options: direction, css3 prog enhancement stuff
 * @TODO fix the resizing business (force full screen and prevent resizing || add resize handler to adjust numbers)
 * @TODO consider adding support for loading images from passed array instead of from DOM
 *
 *
 * To use, just do something like this: $("img").slideshowify();
 *
